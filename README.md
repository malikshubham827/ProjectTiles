# ProjectTiles
A small application *trying to be similar* to piano tiles.
In it a tile is shown at a random postition in black colour and the  user has to click on that and it should change its colour to blue to show that the user has detected the tile successfully.

See Also: The Application_SourceCode file to see code and the description to know the "issues to be resolved".

Features to be out soon( expected after my 2nd sem exam):
1.) Exit if the user press(click , of course, LOL) the wrong tile.
2.) Increase in the speed of the changing  of the position of tiles.
3.) The whole pattern of tile should move either vertically or horizontally.
4.) Performance optimisation on the basis of algorithms , if applicable.
5.) A dedicated page to the project on my website to be live soon (expected after summer vacations).
